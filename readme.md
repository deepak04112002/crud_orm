## Introduction

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that uses an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library with Node.js to interact with a MySQL database. It provides a basic interface for managing records in a database table, serving as a foundational example for building more complex applications.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.
- **ORM Integration**: Utilizes an ORM for database operations, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

## Prerequisites
